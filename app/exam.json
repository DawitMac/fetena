         ],
         "correctAnswer": "Altitude and cloud cover",
         "explanation": "The factors that most strongly affect the spatial distribution of temperature in Ethiopia are altitude and cloud cover. Due to Ethiopia's varied topography, the altitude plays a significant role in temperature variation. As elevation increases, the temperature generally decreases. Cloud cover also influences temperature by affecting solar radiation and heat retention. Higher cloud cover can lead to cooler temperatures by blocking sunlight and reducing solar heating. Other factors, such as latitude and weather systems, do contribute to temperature variation to some extent, but altitude and cloud cover have a more pronounced effect in Ethiopia."

         "explanation": "The statement 'Globes are not visually convenient compared to maps' is not correct. Globes offer a more accurate representation of the Earth's shape and spatial relationships compared to flat maps. On a globe, all meridians (lines of longitude) converge at the poles, and all latitudes (lines of latitude) intersect at right angles with the meridians. This accurate representation is particularly useful for understanding global phenomena, distances, and the relationship between different regions. However, because of their three-dimensional nature, globes are less portable and may not provide detailed information at smaller scales compared to maps."

         "correctAnswer": "Annual rainfall distribution",
         "explanation": "The basis for classifying seasons as summer, autumn, winter, and spring is the 'annual rainfall distribution.' Seasons are typically defined based on the patterns of temperature and precipitation throughout the year. Inmany regions, including Ethiopia, the changing seasons are primarily characterized by shifts in rainfall patterns rather than temperature alone. Summer is typically associated with a season of higher rainfall, while autumn and winter may have moderate to low rainfall. Spring often marks the transition from dry to wet conditions. These variations in rainfall distribution influence agricultural activities, ecological processes, and overall climate dynamics. Therefore, the classification of seasons is primarily based on the annual distribution of rainfall."

The Boserupian theory, proposed by Ester Boserup, suggests that population growth stimulates technological innovation and intensification of agricultural practices to meet increasing food demands. It emphasizes the adaptive responses of societies to population pressures, leading to innovations and improved productivity. On the other hand, the Malthusian theory, formulated by Thomas Malthus, posits that unchecked population growth eventually outstrips the available resources, leading to famine, poverty, and other catastrophic consequences. Malthusian theory highlights the potential negative impacts of population growth on resource availability and sustainability."

         "explanation": "One of the factors that affects the angle at which the sun's rays touch the earth is the 'latitudinal location.' The Earth's tilt on its axis causes variations in the angle at which sunlight reaches different parts of the planet. Near the equator (lower latitudes), the sun's rays strike more directly, resulting in higher solar energy and warmer temperatures. As you move toward the poles (higher latitudes), the angle at which the sun's rays hit the Earth becomes more oblique, leading to lower solar energy and cooler temperatures. This latitudinal variation in solar angle influences climate patterns, seasons, and the distribution of ecosystems across the globe."
